A dreamer, realistic optimist, and blueberry-loving explorer.

I’ve been known to drive in the middle of nowhere at 10 mph following a cyclist. I’m afraid of heights yet I jumped off a building twice, because it was “fun”. When a double century isn’t enough, why not tag a Half Ironman triathlon to the next day?

I like to think that I am a calculated risk taker who cherishes every moment. I am passionate about inspiring and motivating others to lead healthy lives. Always a student. Always inspired. And always smiling.
